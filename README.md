This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML involving the use of a boolean value with the innerHTML property.  The bug arises from attempting to set the innerHTML of a div element to a boolean (true or false). This causes the div to remain empty instead of displaying the boolean value as text. The solution showcases the correct way to handle this by converting the boolean to a string representation before setting the innerHTML.
